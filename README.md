Program the calculator of the fee to be paid by the users of a mobile telephone company. All users must pay a base rate of 10 euros per month as long as they do not speak more than 180 minutes per month. After 180 minutes, users must pay 10 cents for each minute spoken from 180 to 240 minutes.
After 240 minutes, users pay 20 cents per minute for each extra minute consumed after 240 minutes.
The calculator should ask the user for the minutes spoken and return the euros to be paid.
